  "title": "X-Press Pearl inferno : Environmentalists raise concerns on damage assessment process",
  "content": "In September, the International Tank Owners Pollution Federation (ITOPF), a non-government body registered in the UK which is funded by ship owners has been invited by authorities to help in cleaning nurdles and assessing the damage. Environmentalists claim that this Company doesn’t have the required expertise to deal with nurdle spills \nThe X-Press Pearl is currently at a unique marine area and we believe that there are three different types of oil in the ship posing a risk of oil spills in the near future\n\n \n\nFive months after the X-press Pearl container vessel caught fire, Sri Lankan authorities are still taking snail-paced efforts to assess the damage. Even though environmentalists and several marine experts claimed that it appeared to be an irreversible disaster, the government still hasn’t given a clear picture on the matter. It has been estimated that approximately 85 billion high density and low density plastic nurdles spilled from ship. At the onset of the incident, the three armed forces personnel were deployed to manually clear the beaches. Subsequently a local inventor took the initiative to clean the Sarakkuwa Beach which was identified as a red zone. But today, this machine has ceased operations on the request of authorities and on any given day, around 100 women from the local community could be seen at the Sarakkuwa Beach, manually cleaning nurdles, \nsans protective gear or safety measures.  \n\n",
