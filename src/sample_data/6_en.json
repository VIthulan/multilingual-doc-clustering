  "content": "Those who used the Easter Sunday mayhem to gain power will not be able to stay in power for long if they had a hand in it, Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith said yesterday.    \n\nCardinal Ranjith who was speaking at a service held to mark the 30th month since the bomb attacks took place, said it had become a curse as no one can live happily today while many are unable to even earn a living.   \n“It appears that Sri Lanka is suffering a curse since the Easter Sunday bomb attacks as no one can live happily earning whatever they can, while those who are in power find it difficult to run the country. Those who came to power using the Easter Sunday attacks will not be able to hold on to power for long,” Cardinal Ranjith said.   \n“ We sometimes wonder whether those who rule the country today are also stakeholders of the Easter Sunday conspiracy when observing the manner in which the investigations are conducted.” \nhe added.   \n\n\n“We have done everything possible to uncover the truth behind the Easter Sunday mayhem and now we seek divine intervention to uncover the truth and to meet out justice to those who were affected by the tragedy. God will help us as he helped the Israelites to move away from Egypt where they were kept as slaves. The Patron Saint of this church St. Anthony will also intercede on behalf of us in the manner he helped to uncover the truth behind a murder that his own father was accused of” he said.",
