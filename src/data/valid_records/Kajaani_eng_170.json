  "title": "Sri Lanka to go digital — A comprehensive road map to drive #DigitalSriLanka",
  "content": "Sri Lanka has long dreamt of going digital with its basic needs so that the convenience of it is felt by the general public. In this 21st century, digitalization is a key need and even in some developing nations in the region today, basic citizen services have been digitalized such as providing digital identification cards, payment through online methods, and video conferencing in some of these main government departments etc.Today the need to go digital is much greater than ever before, the new normal had demanded a digital connected lifestyle than ever before. With the virus mutating with new variants almost every year and with waves of these mutations keeping countries on edge, digitalization is the key to keeping economies afloat. While Sri Lanka should have implemented some of these basics years ago, unfortunately the previous government failed to take note of this and failed to establish the necessary laws. However, our government is now committed to bringing in new laws and regulations and implement most of the plans from this year, which will all link to the citizen’s digital wallet.In fact this is not rocket science even to the common man. With basic smart phones used by almost all citizens in today’s world, the necessary apps and infrastructure can be easily provided by the government which will enable to adjust to the digital world very quickly. It will also create more youth employment opportunities and enable these trained youth to even compete for jobs in the international market.",
