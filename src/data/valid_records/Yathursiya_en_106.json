"content":"Australia has been denied an unbeaten summer, as Sri Lanka saved face by pulling off an epic five-wicket victory at the MCG.\n\nKusal Mendis was the hero for the tourists, finishing unbeaten on 69 after opening the batting as Sri Lanka chased down Australia’s score of 6-154.\n\nNeeding nine off the last over, captain Dasun Shanaka delivered the decisive blow as he pulled Kane Richardson for six off the quick’s third ball.\n\nThe right-hander was bowled next ball for 35, as he attempted an audacious lap-sweep but only managed to guide the ball back onto his stumps.\n\nRichardson, who clutched his left-hamstring before the ball, was unable to close the innings out.\n\nLeft-arm all-rounder Daniel Sams was given the ball with Sri Lanka needing just one run from the final two deliveries.\n\nChamika Kaunaratne only needed one, as he slogged the ball into the vacant space beyond the in-field.\n\nSome fine work by World Cup hero Matthew Wade had seen Australia set a “competitive score” after Aaron Finch was the toss and elected to bat.\n\nWade, who saw Australia into last year’s World Cup final with some breathtaking batting against Pakistan in the semi-final, smashed an unbeaten 43 from 27.\n\nHis excellent innings saw Australia finish at 6-154 in the fifth and final T20 international, as the home side attempted to complete a series whitewash.\n\nBut Australia’s score always looked 10 short of par.\n\nAustralia lost the game in the power play, where they slumped to 2-12 off 4.5 overs.\n\nFinch has now failed to register a half-century in 13 T20 internationals, while he has not reached double figures in seven of those games.\n\nHis latest failure, an 11-ball eight where he was well caught at mid-on after failing to deal with a slower ball from Dushmantha Chameera.\n\nFellow opener Ben McDermott’s “disappointing run of outs” continued too, as the right-hander lost his shape and got a thick outside edge as he attempted to hit over cow-corner and was out for a 13-ball 3.\n\nAfter a brief recovery, Josh Inglis was forced to go after snicko revealed the ball glanced his glove before being clocked on the helmet after being beaten by pace from an excellent bouncer by Chameera and was forced to go for 23.\n\nAnd when Glenn Maxwell (29) top-edged a cut shot and was caught at third man, Australia was in all sorts at 5-82.\n\nCameos from Marcus Stoinis (17 off 10) and Daniel Sams (18 off 15) helped Australia recover, with Agar four not out.\n\nSri Lanka got off to a flying start thanks to Mendis and Charith Asalanka (20 off 9), but two run outs left the visitors 4-71 and looked like signalling the end of their fight.\n\nBut Shanaka and Mendis had other ideas, combining for an 83-run partnership.\n\nAgar was the pick of the bowlers for Australia, taking 1-19.",
