  "content": "The BCCI has announced the revised dates and venues for Sri Lanka's tour of India, which will comprise three T20Is and two Tests.The tour begins with the first T20I in Lucknow on 24 February, with the other two being back-to-back matches in Dharamsala on 26 and 27 February.This will be followed by the first Test in Mohali from 04 March, before the tour concludes with a day-night Test in Bengaluru starting 12 March.Both Tests will be a part of the second cycle of the World Test Championship.Originally, the tour was scheduled to begin with the T20I series followed by the Tests.The change was done after SLC's request to allow a smoother bubble-to-bubble transfer of their T20I squad, which will have concluded a series in Australia just four days ahead of the first T20I against India.",
