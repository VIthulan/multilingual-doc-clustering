  "content": "The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) has sought “direct engagement” with Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin for a “continued focus” on Sri Lanka’s Tamil question and to strengthen India’s Sri Lanka policy.The TNA and the Global Tamil Forum (GTF), in a statement, said that “Tamils in Sri Lanka are, once again, at a critical point,” citing the “dismal” economic prospects of the war-affected community and mere “marginal” progress on war-time accountability.They pointed to “many existential challenges” faced by Tamils, by way of threats to their land, rampant militarisation and state-sponsored initiatives aimed at “altering regional demography,” reports ‘The Hindu’.“It is feared a new Constitution under preparation could further weaken the status of the Tamil people, especially by abolishing or weakening the Provincial Councils – the only constitutional power devolution arrangement Tamil people achieved with direct Indian involvement,” the TNA and GTF said.",
