  "content": "Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal has blamed delayed support from multilateral lenders as well as higher cost of imports for a spike in inflation.Addressing the Asia Economic Dialogue 2022 virtually, he said the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was late in providing support to Sri Lanka during the pandemic.According to him, the delay fueled additional inflation.Sri Lanka last month saw its nationwide inflation increase 16.8 per cent led by failed harvests, import curbs to conserve dwindling foreign-exchange reserves, and high global prices of key commodities.Inflation is a challenge for Sri Lanka, Cabraal said.Several Cabinet Ministers and Members of Parliament have been asking the Government to seek assistance from the IMF as the country faces difficulties in importing essential goods due to the US dollar shortage.",
