  "content": "The European Union (EU) has called for the lifting of import restrictions imposed by Sri Lanka, at the European Union meeting in Brussels yesterday. The EU strongly urged Sri Lanka to lift forthwith import restrictions preventing many European products from entering its market. Sri Lanka clarified that it has imposed temporary import restrictions on non-essential items, strictly as an interim measure, due to a foreign exchange shortfall resulting from the impact of the global pandemic. Sri Lanka noted that these measures are subject to continuous and progressive review. Sri Lanka appreciated the valued contribution of the GSP+ regime to the country’s sustainable development.",
