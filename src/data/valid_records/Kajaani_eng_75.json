Sampanthan was yet to receive any response to two letters he has sent to president Gotabaya Rajapaksa against the stateâ€™s takeover of the land under special laws.Either the president or the prime minister should come in person and receive yet another letter, said MP Rasamanickam Shanakiyan.Spokesman to the president Kingsley Ratnayake said the MPs had arrived without making any prior notice, to handover a letter to the president.It is clearly a planned conspiracy to send a wrong message about the government to the UN Human Rights Council, Ratnayake charged.",
