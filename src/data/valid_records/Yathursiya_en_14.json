The first AC DMU supplied under this LoC was put into operation on 09 January 2022.\n\nThe US$ 318 million LoC was finalized in 2014-15 for the supply of railway rolling stock to Sri Lanka, upgradation of railway tracks and other mutually agreed projects in accordance with request and requirements of Government of Sri Lanka. \n\nSince then, high quality railway coaches and AC DMUs supplied from India have helped strengthen the railway infrastructure as well as travel experience in Sri Lanka, the Indian High Commission said. \n\nVarious other projects under this LoC including the upgradation of railway tracks are at different stages of implementation.\n\nLines of Credit from India have contributed to the upgradation of the railway line from Colombo to Matara, track laying on sectors such as Omanthai-Pallai; Madhu Church-Tallaimannar; Medawachchiya-Madhu; and Pallai-Kankesanthurai, installing signalling systems, and supply of rolling stock to Sri Lanka railways. \n\n“India looks forward to continue mutually beneficial cooperation in the transport sector, including in railways where India’s world class capabilities and assistance have contributed significantly to the development of railway infrastructure and facilities, job creation, economic growth, enhanced connectivity and passenger comfort and safety in Sri Lanka,” the statement said.",
