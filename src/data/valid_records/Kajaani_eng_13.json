  "content": "The Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA) is on the war path against the ‘ad hoc’ manner in which the government gives pay hikes. Secretary of the Government Medical Officers’ Association (GMOA), Dr. Senal Fernando, yesterday (17) warned that his union would launch a token strike on Monday (21) against the blatant violation of the national wage policy and forcing the public service into a spate of strikes by ad hoc approval of Cabinet papers related to wage issues.  Dr. Fernando said the decision had been taken at an emergency general committee meeting summoned yesterday (17) to decide on the mode of action to be taken against the upward trend of submitting Cabinet papers as the answer to demands made for salary increases. He accused the Government of pushing the state service into an abyss by blatantly violating the wage policy. “Having come to power as a policy-driven government, it is blatantly violating those policies,” he said.",
