  "content": "The bakery owners and the business community in the Hatton area say that the wheat flour companies have reduced the amount of wheat flour supplied to them by 35%. For about a month now, major wheat flour companies have not been able to supply wheat flour agents in the Hatton area with an adequate supply of wheat flour, and they say they are being supplied with limited quantities of wheat flour. At present, a kilo of wheat flour distributed by the company sells for Rs 145. Businessmen in the Hatton area claim that they are selling less than the required amount of wheat flour to consumers who buy groceries from their stores. Bakery owners in the Hatton area say that their bakeries are running at a loss due to this.",
