  "content": "General Secretary of the All Ceylon Private Bus Ownersâ€™ Association (ACPBOA), Anjana Priyanjith yesterday (23), warned that 15,000 private buses will be taken off the roads if the Government fails to provide a diesel subsidy within 48 hours.He said, close to 18,000 private buses are in operation throughout the country and that a sizeable number of long-distance buses had stopped plying due to the ongoing fuel crisis and industry-related issues.Priyanjith stressed if the Government strives to increase diesel prices in the coming weeks, they will need to seriously consider providing a diesel subsidy to the private bus industry.He also mentioned, the ACPBOA will be forced to hike bus fares with much reluctance if the Government is unable to grant this relief.",
