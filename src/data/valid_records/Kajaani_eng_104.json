He also said that the President had directed the Cabinet to assist the administration in improving its institutions.Meanwhile, when asked if the country can move forward in the face of the power crisis caused by the CEB’s failure to implement power cuts according to the schedule, Dr. Pathirana noted that the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) had asked the CEB to submit a clear timetable to enforce power cuts because the public was greatly inconvenienced as a result.He did, however, admit that the country is in a state of crisis and that the necessary background has been created to deal with the situation to the best of his ability.The Co-Cabinet spokesman also added that he is certain that the current crisis scenario will improve and that power outages would be implemented in a systematic manner with prior notice.",
