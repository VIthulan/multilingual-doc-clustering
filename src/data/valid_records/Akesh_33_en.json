  "content": "His Eminence Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith says that it can be proven that the Government has not fulfilled a single one of its promises so far, while the belief that justice will be ensured to the victims of the Easter attack is being eroded day by day. Participating in the book launch of the book ‘Thitha’, he pointed out that those who are supposed to enforce the law and the mechanism by which it should be enforced have become problematic. However, he mentioned that the evidence given to the commission is still hidden by this Government and the present Attorney General, and although letters were sent requesting for the volumes that contain the evidence, the previous and the present Government did nothing but to hide the volumes without even considering the requests.
