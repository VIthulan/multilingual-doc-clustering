  "content": "UNP MP Ranil Wickremesinghe urged the Government on Tuesday (22) to purchase fuel shipments from ships currently berthed at Colombo Port as soon as possible, as the fuel and LNG prices in the global market will increase in the coming days owing to Russia-Ukraine tensions. Speaking in Parliament, Wickremesinghe said Russian Forces entering Ukraine would have an impact on fuel and LNG prices in the global market. “Fuel and LNG prices in the global market will increase in the coming days due to Russia-Ukraine tensions. A crude oil barrel would be priced at about US$ 115. There are three fuel tankers berthed at Colombo Port at the moment. If we make payments now, we can purchase fuel stocks for previous prices. So, we have to find dollars to make payments for the shipments somehow. I do not know how to find the necessary dollars. But we have to do something regarding the matter, otherwise it would affect us badly in the coming days,” he pointed out. Speaking further, Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka would not be able to get adequate stocks of LNG as Europe had ordered large stocks from Qatar following the situation in Ukraine. “With this situation, it would be better if Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa could make a statement on Wednesday (23) before the Adjournment Motion of the Opposition is moved in the morning,” he said.
