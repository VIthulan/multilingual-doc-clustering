  "content": "The Ministry of Power stated that it does not expect any power cuts in any part of the island today. Ministry Secretary Wasantha Perera told the Hiru News team that the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CEYPETCO) has agreed to supply fuel to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) enough to supply electricity for today. However, she said that due to the increase in fuel prices in the world market, it may be necessary to restrict the availability of fuel in the future. Accordingly, the Secretary to the Ministry of Power stated that lengthy discussions have already commenced with a number of sectors to provide a continuous supply of electricity. She further stressed that all citizens should be supported to use electricity sparingly to maintain an uninterrupted power supply.",
