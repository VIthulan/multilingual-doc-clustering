  "content": "With the ongoing power cuts being extended to over five hours from today (25), and with no end in sight to the fuel crisis, the health sector is tipped to be crippled soon, worried health officials warned.Deputy Director General of Disaster Management and Emergency Response (DMER), Dr. Hemantha Herath yesterday (24) said, the health sector is currently relying heavily on generators and backup generators the hospitals possess, in case of an emergency, adding however, that the persisting fuel shortage could hinder this.Dr. Herath said, the CEB also maintained the generators for the hospitals while up to now there was an adequate amount of diesel to operate them. â€œBut our fear is that there may be a shortage of fuel for the backup generators that hospitals have -- especially the large hospitals. Sources at the National Hospital, Colombo, when contacted for comment, said the hospitals had been spared the severity of the power cuts till now. With the several lines that supply power to the hospital, the CEB has minimised the impact by sparing the high risk areas of the hospital such as the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and Theatres. ",
