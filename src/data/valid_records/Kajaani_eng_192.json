  "content": "UNP Chairman Vajira Abeywardena yesterday (27) claimed that Sri Lanka’s economic crisis was more serious than the Russian- Ukraine war. After the Covid-19 pandemic, many countries took steps to strengthen their economies.While addressing the Media in Galle, Abeywardena said as the Government failed to take such efforts, today, the country was facing an unfortunate situation. This situation cannot be overcome by pointing fingers at others or blaming them. Rather than criticising each other or blaming others, the main political parties must come to a common platform setting their personal disputes aside in the interest of the people and work in unison to provide livelihoods to the people.He said the shortage of fuel has turned out to be major problem. The power crisis has severely impacted every sector. In the face of this situation, it would be difficult to take the country forward through tourism or any other sector.",
