  "content": "Seems like Anil Kapoor takes his fitness regime very seriously even when he is on a holiday. The actor, 65, shared pictures from his holiday album. The location? Sri Lanka. In some of the pictures, the actor can be seen strolling on the beach. In another shot, he can be seen playing snooker. Our favourite has to be the one in which he can be seen flexing his muscles as he poses for the camera. Anil Kapoor captioned the Twitter post: 'Exploring Bentota.' He added the hashtag #ADayInSriLanka.",
