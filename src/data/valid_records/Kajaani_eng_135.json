  "content": "In light of the fuel crisis, President of the Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association Gemunu Wijeratne says that obtaining fuel for private buses has become an issue.The Lanka Indian Oil Company last night (25) increased its fuel prices for the second time this month. Consumers are made to purchase fuel mainly from LIOC outlets because a majority of CEYPETCO sheds have limited fuel stocks. Motorists who visit filling stations that do have fuel, experience long queues.At this rate, the number of private buses operating for public transport will have to be limited, Wijeratne says.He points out that after the majority of the fuel stocks available in the country are used for power generation, only a fraction of the stocks are left for use by the public.Hence, the government must offer a practicable solution as soon as possible to avoid inconveniences to both the public and private transport sectors and their users, Wijeratne adds.",
