  "content": "The average daily maximum demand for electricity in the country is around 2650 MW, and a significant portion of this is generated to the national grid from the Mahaweli, Laxapana and Samanala hydropower plants.The country has been facing two major issues ever since the beginning of last December with regard to the energy sector. These include the country facing a dollar crisis which made it impossible to purchase even the most basic necessities, including fuel. A complaint was lodged on the morning of the 3rd that the electrical engineers were allowed to rectify the power outage.In addition, the reservoirs that could have been used sparingly until March and April will have to open up a little more water to generate electricity.",
