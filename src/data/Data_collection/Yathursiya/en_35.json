"content":"The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) has directed the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to adjust island-wide rotational power cuts today to facilitate the ongoing G.C.E. Advanced Level examination.\n\nAccordingly, two-hour interruptions to the electricity supply will be experienced between 4.30 p.m. and 10.30 p.m. today, the PUCSL chairman Janaka Ratnayake said.\n\nYesterday, the electricity sector regulator stated that approval was given for scheduled power cuts for today Feb. 21 on the request of the CEB, due to inadequate electricity generation.\n\nIt was decided that one-hour rotational power cuts would be imposed between 8.30 a.m. and 7.30 p.m. today in all areas except for the Southern Province.\n\nHowever, taking into account the ongoing A/L exam, which is taking place from February 07 to March 05, the PUCSL has instructed the CEB to adjust the rotational power cuts scheduled for today.",
