"content":"Hosts Australians after opting to bowl first in the 3rd T20I, restricted Sri Lanka to 121/6 in 20 overs at Manuka Oval, Canberra. \n\nPathum Nissanka (16), Dinesh Chandimal (25) and captain Dasun Shanaka were the only Lankan batters to cross the double-digit mark.\n\nFor Australia, Kane Richardson was the pick of the bowlers with 3 wickets. Apart from Richardson, Hazlewood, Agar and Maxwell picked up 1 wicket each.\n\nAustralia are already 2-0 ahead in the 5-match T20I series and if they successfully chase down 122 in this match, the series would be sealed for them.\n\nEarlier, Australian captain Aaron Finch won the toss and opted to field first against Sri Lanka in the 3rd T20I.
