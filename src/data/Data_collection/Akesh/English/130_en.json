  "content": "The Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka has announced that there is a bilateral understanding between the Government of Sri Lanka and the Government of India regarding the auction of fishing boats in Sri Lankan custody. They said that a team from Tamil Nadu was scheduled to visit the island to take a final decision on the disposal of the non-repairable fishing boats in Sri Lankan custody. The Indian High Commission has again requested the Government of Sri Lanka for an opportunity to do so. Fishermen in Rameshwaram, Tamil Nadu have started a strike against the auction of confiscated Indian fishing vessels. They also staged a protest in front of the Rameshwaran Fisheries Office, demanding that the Sri Lankan government pay at least 25 percent of the proceeds from the auction of Indian fishing vessels to India. They also demanded the release of 11 Indian fishermen and three trawlers arrested while fishing illegally near the Delft Island in Jaffna.",
