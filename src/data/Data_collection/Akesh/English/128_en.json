  "content": "At six feet, seven inches, Prasidh Krishna can generate bounce even on the most docile tracks. It helps that his stock ball is mostly back of a length. He trusts that length to such an extent that it's become muscle memory. Not only does Prasidh bowl this length consistently, he does so at 140 clicks or more. That's why West Indies had no answers against him. His opening burst of 4-2-3-2 stung them and what appeared to be a low-pressure chase was turned upside down. Prasidh didn't bowl a single full delivery in his first four overs. Sixteen out of 24 balls reared up from short of length. Five of them nipped away off a length. The batters tried to weather this barrage but it was no use. West Indies were being made painfully aware that this wasn't going to be a stroll.",
