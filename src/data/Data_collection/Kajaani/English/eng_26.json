The Governor added, “This year, all Sri Lankan Development Bonds have rolled over, which amounts to around US$ 300 million, and also treasury bills and bond auctions are all successful with interest rates marginally reducing, which shows investor confidence.” When questioned regarding going for an IMF programme, Cabraal replied that there is no need for an IMF programme as the investors are confident in Sri Lanka and this is reflected in bond subscription.",
