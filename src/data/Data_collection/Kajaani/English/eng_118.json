  "content": "Jathika Jana Balawegaya (JJB) MP Vijitha Herath yesterday (24), queried as to why the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) did not terminate the electricity supply to the residence of a powerful Cabinet Minister, when he had amassed an electricity bill of over Rs 12 million. Speaking in Parliament, Herath said the CEB has recently informed the Minister to settle the Bill as soon as possible. “The CEB’s letter to Minister Keheliya Rambukwella came only after the media reported it. It is reported that he has not settled his electricity bill for a few years. Also, it is reported that officials who went to check on the matter have not been allowed inside the residence. How can this happen? When a normal person does not settle the electricity bill for two or three months, the CEB takes immediate action to disconnect the electricity supply. They even impose a surcharge to restore the electricity. All of these laws are applicable for the common people only. The Law does not apply to Ministers. Is this how the Government is going to establish the ‘One Country – One Law’ concept?” Herath queried. ",
