  "content": "Twelve Tamil Parliamentarians from the North and East, headed by TNA MPs, staged an ‘awareness’ protest at Galle Face and inside the Parliament Chamber yesterday (24), alleging the Department of Archaeology is seizing people’s lands claiming them to be valuable archaeological sites.They also said, the Forest Department is demarking lands under the guise of forest conservation, but that some of the lands taken away are for the people who live in the vicinity. “Lands belonging to Tamils have been taken away under the guise of the Mahaweli Development Project,” they said.The Government has been informed of the land-grab, but to no avail, the protesting MPs said.The unannounced visit of several MPs from the Eastern Province to meet the President, which later turned into a protest outside the Presidential Secretariat, was interpreted yesterday by the Presidential Media Centre as a plot to embarrass the Government ahead of the upcoming United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) sessions in Geneva.",
