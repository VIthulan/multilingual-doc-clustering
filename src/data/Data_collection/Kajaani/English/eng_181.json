When we earn US$100, we must pay off US$115 in debt. The funds obtained by the country are insufficient to pay off the country’s debts. I have gathered data on non-essential commodities brought into our country in 2021,” he explained.Citing figures, he stated that in 2021, US$ 6 billion was spent on non-essential food imports such as cheese, butter, vegetables, fruits, ice cream, chocolate, and sauces.
