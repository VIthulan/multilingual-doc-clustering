  "content": "Sri Lanka has turned to its immediate neighbour India for economic help as the island country struggles with paying back Chinese loans. As there are high possibilities of a ‘debt trap’ over the failure of Chinese loans, Colombo has sought help from India.Sri Lanka cannot afford to be completely dependent on China, which not only places the country at economic risk but can hurt its interest in the wake of rising Indian ambitions and the formation of the United States-led Quadrilateral Security Group (QUAD).Sri Lanka is reported to have received loans worth USD 5 billion from China for the construction of roads, ports and airports.However, the Covid-19 led disruption affected the country’s ability to pay back the loan. Thus, Colombo in January asked Beijing to restructure its debt. This is one of the major reasons for sentiments to go against China.The tourism-dependent economy, which was crippled by the foreign exchange crisis, was seen struggling to pay off even fuel imports bill.",
