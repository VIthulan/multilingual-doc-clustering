  "content": "SJB MP M. Imran said the people in the Eastern Province have begun to reject members of Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC), although the party was established in the Eastern Province by the late M. H. M. Ashraff.Imran said this reaction clearly indicates that the public were beginning to reject the SLMC and will do so at future Elections. He said the time has come for the Muslims to take serious note of this sutuation.“The people have now realised that Ashraff’s decision to form a Muslim party was not in the best interest of the community and the people’s decision to join majority parties was a good sign and a step in the right direction,” Imran said.",
