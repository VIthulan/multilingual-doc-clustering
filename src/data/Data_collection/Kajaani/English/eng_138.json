  "content": "Speaker of Parliament Mahinda Yapa Abeywardene has requested the Inspector General of Police to probe an unauthorised item being brought into Parliament.It was over opposition MP Harin Fernando's having brought three torches to the parliamentary complex.Leader of the House Minister Dinesh Gunawardena claimed the incident posed a grave threat to the lives of MPs, adding that necessary action should be taken over the matter.Opposition MPs argued, however, that similar incidents had occurred previously, recalling the time where MPs were hurling chilli powder at each other in the House. MP Chaminda Wijesiri further argued that a torch posed a substantially less, or rather no threat to the livesof MPs , as opposed to chilli powder. Parliamentary proceedings were suspended for nearly 10 minutes last morning (24) following allegations by Leader of the House Minister Dinesh Gunawardena that an opposition MP brought an unauthorised item into the chamber.",
