At this juncture, Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kiriella said similar incidents had occurred in the House during the past, and that they have become almost a  ‘Sri Lankan tradition’.“In one such incident, a wreath was placed in front of where the former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was seated some years ago. I request you to think about it. However, we will accept the Speaker’s decision on this,” Kiriella said. The Chief Government Whip said they understand Kiriella’s concerns. “We have done similar things in the Chamber too. So we perfectly understand. But in this particular incident, these MPs had tried to smuggle a parcel into the Chamber and they had threatened the Policemen who tried to stop them,” he said. ",
