  "title": "Pro-Poor Tourism: Can it Reduce Poverty in Sri Lanka?",
  "content": "The tourism industryâ€™s performance was hampered first by the Easter Sunday bomb explosions in 2019 and then the Covid-19 pandemic. Sri Lanka saw a decline in tourist arrivals from 1,913,702 in 2019 to 194,495 in 2021. It is estimated that revenue declined from US$ 3,600 million to US$ 261 million during 2019-2021, reflecting a staggering 92.75% reduction due to a fall in arrivals.At present, the Government is severely challenged with maintaining funds for basic provisions, and expansive investments in tourism cannot be expected in the foreseeable future. In November 2021, the Ministry of Tourism released the draft National Policy on Tourism for Sri Lanka with recommendations for improvement. Among them are the promotion of sustainable local tourism in Sri Lanka and community engagement.This article discusses existing disparities in tourism and the possibility of adopting a sustainable, pro-poor tourism strategy to reduce poverty in Sri Lanka.",
