  "content": "The All Ceylon Private Bus Owners’ Association (ACPBOA) warned that buses will soon grind to a halt due to fuel shortage.Speaking to Ceylon Today on Friday (25), ACPBOA Chairman, Anjana Priyanjith said, “We have obtained diesel by staying in long queues, so we can manage to operate for two to three days. But by next week, this situation might worsen and disrupt public transportation.”The Lanka Private Bus Owners’ Association (LPBOA) claimed that no clear solution was provided by the Transport Ministry for the fuel shortage.LPBOA Chairman, Gemunu Wijeratne, said only 25 per cent of buses functioned on Thursday (24) due to the fuel crisis. “Those buses too will stop operating in the coming week, if there is no solution to the fuel shortage. We spoke to the Transport Minister, yet we did not receive any positive response,” added Wijeratne.On a separate note, speaking to Ceylon Today on 24 January, Lanka Three Wheeler Drivers’ Association Chairman, Lalith Dharmasekara, said apart from the fuel shortage and a possible fuel price hike, they will have to cope with irregularities in three-wheeler fares. “We had to stay in line for hours to purchase fuel. Yet, most of us left disappointed because the stations ran out. This shortage has affected many daily wage-earning three-wheeler drivers and transport sector workers,” he added.He said if this shortage is going to cause a price hike, the Government should resolve irregularities in three-wheeler fares.  However, National Transport Commission (NTC) Director General, Nilan Miranda, said their buses operated as scheduled. ",
