  "content": "SJB General Secretary, MP Ranjith Maddumabandara filed a Special Determination Petition before the Supreme Court yesterday (23) for a determination that certain clauses of the Surcharge Tax Bill are in violation of the Constitution and thus cannot be enacted into law unless approved by a two-thirds majority vote and/or by the people at a Referendum.It was stated the provisions of the Bill would include the Employee Provident Fund (EPF), the Employee Trust Fund (ETF) and the Mercantile Service Provident Fund and that those contributions by the Employee and the Employer to the EPF and ETF are mandated through statute and thus held in trust by the State for and on behalf of the employee contributor.   ‘’Funds that could be taxed under the Bill may consist of welfare benefit schemes that serve to assist persons falling within those schemes, and the imposition of a Surcharge Tax on such funds and the remittance would permit the Parliament to arbitrarily utilise an excess amount of the taxable income of such funds for purposes that may not fall within the purview of the welfare benefit schemes’ it was stated.",
