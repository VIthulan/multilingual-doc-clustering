  "content": "Kalmunai Mayor, senior Attorney-at-Law A. M. Rakeeb on 22 February said a massive signature colleting campaign demanding the Government to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) was held with the participation of political parties and public organisations in various parts of the Ampara District including Kalmunai and Karaitivu areas.Rakeeb further stated that the signature campaign was chaired by Ilankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK) Youth Front Deputy Leader A. Nithansan.  Rakeeb said“The PTA gives Police broad powers to search, arrest and detain suspects. It was first enacted as a temporary law in 1979 under the presidency of J. R. Jayewardena and was made permanent in 1982 and feared that this Act would lead the country towards dictatorship”.This Act is against what had been indicated in the Charter of Human Rights which was enacted after the Second World War. It is not necessary to the people of this country. It is a Law against natural justice. In case a person is arrested under this Act, he or she has no right even to express their views, Rakeeb said.",
