  "content": "Filling stations in the country are reportedly restricting issuing diesel. Signboards are placed at several filling stations stating that the supply of diesel has been restricted.The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (Ceypetco) has urged the public to use diesel sparingly in the coming days. The reason for this is that at present, Ceypetco has only enough diesel stocks for about 7 days.It may take about 6 days for another diesel ship to reach Sri Lanka. It is also understood that it will take more than two days to unload the diesel from the ship, after it arrives at the port.Therefore, Ceypetco officials point out that the diesel stocks in the country should be used sparingly until a ship carrying the next load of diesel arrives in the country and unloads.The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation sources stated that due to this reason, the quantity of diesel issued to filling stations has been restricted.",
