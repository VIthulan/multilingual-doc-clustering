  "content": "UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet has expressed deep concern over a number of human rights trends in Sri Lanka.“Sri Lanka will only achieve sustainable development and peace and lasting reconciliation if it ensures civic space, independent and inclusive institutions, and puts an end to systemic impunity,” she says.In a statement on developments in Sri Lanka since last year, Bachelet recognizes recent steps taken to initiate reforms.“While we recognize the renewed willingness of the Government of Sri Lanka to engage constructively with our Office, including in the preparation of the report, we urge the Government to go much further with the legal, institutional, and security sector reforms necessary to comply with Sri Lanka’s international human rights obligations.In the past year, we have observed setbacks to accountability for past human rights violations and recognition of victims’ rights. The High Commissioner highlights particularly the continuing precarious situation of the families of the disappeared – the majority of whom are represented by women. We urge the Government to acknowledge their sufferings, urgently determine the fate or whereabouts of victims, provide reparations, and bring perpetrators to justice.",
