  "content": "Seylan Bank has gone into partnership with the Department of Pensions, to enable the issuance of the Life Certificate to pensioners via biometric authentication. The Life Certificate is an important document that is used to verify a pensioner’s living status. The machine will utilise the pensioner’s fingerprint to issue the Life Certificate, making the process simple, efficient and easily accessible for all pensioners.In the past, all pensioners mailed applications for the Pensioner Life Certificate during a specific time period of the year. Seylan Bank has now incorporated the latest technological enhancements from the Department of Pensions in order to issue Life Certificates at 75 branches. This hassle-free method eliminates the need to wait in queues and aids the protection of senior citizens, especially with the ongoing pandemic. ",
