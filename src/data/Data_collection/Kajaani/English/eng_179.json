  "content": "Chief Government Whip, Minister Johnston Fernando warned the prices of essential commodities may rise further as a result of the Russia-Ukraine war.Responding to questions from the Media on the Opposition’s claims that there was no food, fuel, or electricity, he stated the Government had decided not to halt any development projects. “We have to admit there is a cement problem today. That is because of the increased demand owing to the boom of the construction industry. The opposition members think that there would be regime change on the basis of these temporary shortages. That is why they stage protests carrying torches. They do not even know how to organise a protest properly.  Otherwise they would not have grabbed temporary issues to campaign against a Government,” he noted.Speaking further he also said that as a responsible Minister, he acknowledge that there are problems and if there was no dollar crisis the Government would not have let people stand in queues.
