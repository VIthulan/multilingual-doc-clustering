  "content": "Sri Lankan banks are likely to face continued asset-quality pressure in 2022 as rising macroeconomic stresses stemming from the sovereign credit profile pose a threat to borrowers' repayment capacity, alongside the conclusion of most relief measures in 2021, says Fitch Ratings. Fitch-rated banks' Stage 3 (impaired) loans ratio has remained broadly unchanged since 2019 (9M21: 9.4 per cent, 2019: 9.5 per cent), as relief measures prevented deterioration in lending quality. However, asset-quality pressure was evident in elevated loan-impairment charges and a rising share of Stage 2 loans in gross loans. The share of loans under moratorium at Fitch-rated banks declined, estimated at 10 per cent of gross loans at end-September 2021 (end-1H20: 26 per cent). Fitch expects Sri Lanka's economic performance to weaken in 2022, forecasting growth to slow to 2.0 per cent, although downside risks to forecasts remain.",
