  "content": "The water supply has also been affected due to the scheduled disruption of the power supply, the public charged.They said the water supply had been provided in low pressure during the beginning of the one-hour power cut and had later completely been disrupted.The public further said that the water supply had been affected in this manner during the last two days in which power cuts were imposed. The National Water Supply and Drainage Board has revealed that water supply would not have been affected in Colombo as measures had been taken to provide uninterrupted power supply to the Ambatale and Biyagama water plants.The Board said, however, if electricity is not provided continuously for 2-hours to the said water plants then it could result in disruptions of the water supply. The Water Board further said measures have been taken to obtain uninterrupted electricity supply from the Ceylon Electricity Board to operate the water plants. ",
