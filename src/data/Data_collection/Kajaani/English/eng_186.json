  "content": "Beijing imposing sanctions against Sri Lanka after Colombo rejected the fertiliser consignment of a Chinese firm underscores the souring of relations between the two countries, said a think tank, Policy Research Group (POREG).China weaved its way into Sri Lanka through its policy of lending shoulders to countries shunned by international communities for poor human rights records. Similarly, Beijing warmed up to Colombo when Sri Lanka became an outcast state with allegations of state-sponsored human rights abuses during Tamil Tigers-led insurgency in the country.In 2007, when the USA ended its military aid to Sri Lanka and India refused to sell offensive weapons, China along with military equipment provided aid of USD 1 billion to Sri Lanka, the think tank reported.With its habitual policy of promising economic assistance to a pariah State, Beijing has now Colombo enmeshed in a debt trap, luring it with the bait called the ‘Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)’.",
