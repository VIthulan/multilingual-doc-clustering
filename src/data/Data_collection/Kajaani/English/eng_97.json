  "content": "State Minister of Production, Supply and Regulation of Pharmaceuticals (PSRP), Prof. Channa Jayasumana alleged that there had been a 22 per cent quality failure in the medicinal drugs that were being imported during the tenure of the Yahapalana Government. Prof. Jayasumana on Tuesday (22) said, with continuous monitoring his Ministry had been able to reduce it to four per cent. “We are doing our best to reduce it to zero per cent with regular checking,” he said.  Responding to questions, the State Minister said Sri Lanka imported a majority of its medicinal drugs from India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Some were also imported from China. Majority quality failures occurred in the medicines that were imported from India, Bangladesh and Pakistan owing to the large amounts that were imported to the island. In addition, the mass production of those drugs in those countries was also a cause for the drop in quality. Moreover, there are different qualities of drugs that are imported, he said.   ",
