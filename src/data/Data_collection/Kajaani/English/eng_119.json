  "content": "UNP Chairman Vajira Abeywardena yesterday (24) alleged that due to the imprudent administration of the Government, every sector in the country has been plunged into crisis.Abeywardena said the shortage of fuel has turned into a severe issue. A situation would soon arise where the public would have to keep their vehicles at home. Blaming the public for topping up their fuel tanks was to no avail to overcome the shortage and saying they were not concerned about the fuel crisis was useless. Speaking to Ceylon Today Abeywardena said the country has been pushed into dire straits today. Meanwhile, UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe has warned that if such a situation continues, the exchange rate of the Sri Lankan rupees against US Dollar would go up from Rs 275 to Rs 300 by the end of this year. This is a situation that has never arisen before. The UNP was always of the view that if such a situation is to be overcome, IMF assistance must be sought and their instructions should be followed.",
