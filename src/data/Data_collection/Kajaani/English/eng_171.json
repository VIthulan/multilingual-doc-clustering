  "content": "Tamil National Alliance (TNA), together with the Global Tamil Forum (GTF), an organisation proscribed in Sri Lanka, has issued a statement recently, congratulating M.K. Stalin for completing one year as Chief Minister of India’s Tamil Nadu State.The joint statement has been signed on behalf of the TNA by Member of Sri Lanka’s Parliament, M.A. Sumanthiran, and for the GTF, its Spokesperson Suren Surendiran, who has also been named as a proscribed person by the Government of Sri Lanka. The statement,while praising Stalin for making progress in a short span, also seeks “guidance and support from India and Tamil Nadu” as the Tamils of Sri Lanka aspire for a “degree of self-rule” in North and East of Sri Lanka. “Tamil people in Sri Lanka aspire for a degree of self-rule in the areas of their historic habitation (the NorthEast) and believe this empowerment is fundamental for their equal citizenship in Sri Lanka and to protect their unique identity in the island – a position that always resonated with Tamil Nadu and Indian thinking and policy positions,” the statement said.It added: “Chief Minister Stalin’s supportive approach towards the Tamil struggle in Sri Lanka is consistent with the long tradition of Dravidian political leaders of Tamil Nadu, particularly his illustrious father, late Hon. Kalaignar M. Karunanidhi. Tamil people in Sri Lanka and their political leaders looked upon the leaders of Tamil Nadu for guidance, support and inspiration. Their support – directly, as well as through the Government of India – has always been a great source of comfort for the Tamil people living in Sri Lanka.",
