I am prepared to face any inquiry, but I urge the Speaker not to make this a bigger issue than it really is. I never brought anything dangerous item to Parliament.”\nHarin Fernando also said that he would be engaging in a certain matter pertaining to the release of former MP Ranjan Ramanayake next Monday and urged the government not to obstruct him in his efforts for his colleague and friend Ramanayake.",
