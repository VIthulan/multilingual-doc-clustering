    "content": "Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday expressed his condolences on the death of veteran journalist and former ANCL Chairman Bandula Padmakumara.\nBandula Padmakumara, who later in his career served as the Editorial Director and Chairman of Lake House (ANCL) took Sri Lankan journalism to a whole new level, the Prime Minister in a message said.\nThe message: “I am deeply saddened to hear the news of the death of veteran journalist Bandula Padmakumara, the founding editor of Lakbima Irida Sangrahaya, which revolutionized national journalism”. Bandula Padmakumara, who entered the media world with the film magazine Geetha in the seventies became the founding editor of Kumari, a popular newspaper which began in 80’s that won the hearts of young people at that time.\nIn search of new avenues in journalism, he published several newspapers such as Sarasi, Satsara, Kumari, Rajina, Araliya and Photography.\nAs a trend setter in journalism he joined Sumathi newspaper company and became the editor of the Lakbima Sunday paper. Bandula Padmakumara, a veteran journalist, was able to popularise the art of reading newspapers on television in the late 90's, changing the direction of his journey.\nIt was Padmakumara who for the first time in history, added a tabloid-sized supplement to a weekend national newspaper. Since then, it has been followed by every weekend newspaper in Sri Lanka.\nBandula Padmakumara made an indelible mark in the history of youth and women's newspapers in Sri Lanka. May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana. I extend my deepest condolences to the bereaved family members, fellow journalists, relatives and friends",
