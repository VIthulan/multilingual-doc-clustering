Sri Lanka, with its vibrant past in the gem and jewelry trade, will for the first time, display an extraordinary selection of its most exclusive sapphires, showcasing its rich national wonders and artistry.\n‘Day of Sapphires’ is set to transport visitors across the ages, through surviving treasures, like one engraved 14th century ring which adorns a sapphire from the 10th century with an Arabic name, thought to be from when Arab jewelers were known to travel through Sri Lanka on trading voyages as early as AD 1130.\nGracing her presence, renowned jewelry specialist Helen Molesworth is set to lead a walk-through to explain the importance of the gemstones of Sri Lankan: their place in history, trade, and enduring fascination through time all over the world.
