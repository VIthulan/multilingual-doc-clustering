    "content": "Tourism Minister Prasanna Ranatunga said the country will be able to emerge from the current economic crisis within the next six months.\n“The government has taken effective policy actions to overcome the difficulties caused by the crisis and only this government can save the country and protect its people from the present crisis,” Minister Prasanna Ranatunga said.\nIt is a greater joke than the previous “Yahapalana” government which destroyed the country and is seeking power again.The Opposition Leader cannot even control his own Party today. Then how can he govern the country? the Minister queried.\n“We are already facing a tough time due to the adverse impacts of the pandemic.In Sri Lanka, as in other countries, the loss of jobs and incomes incurred by the pandemic has been severe. While workers in almost every sector have been affected, informal workers who make up about 70 percent of the workforce and especially those in the industries and low-end services such as trade, are likely to be the most affected.We apologise for the inconvenience caused to the citizens due to the economic crisis.\nHowever, the government at present is taking all possible measures in rebuilding the country and people’s lives,” he added.",
