Police said the suspect, Suresh Ganesh Kumara (40) a resident of Badowita, Mount Lavinia has a compulsion to steal only push cycles only.\nThe Magistrate ordered that he be sent for rehabilitation when he was produced before Courts last week.\n“He rides away with an unattended push cycle parked in front of a shop or a house while roaming. He is not a drug addict.\nHe sells stolen bikes to people such as construction workers, factory workers and similar persons types at very low prices,” police said.\n“It is as if he was obsessed about bicycles. He showed no interest in money,” police said.\n“He does not seem to plan the theft except that he could not resist the temptation of riding away with the unguarded bicycle when he sees one,” they said.\n“However, the suspect was responsible for many push-bicycle thefts that had taken place in the Panadura police area.”\nKeselwatta Police SI Hirantha, PC Dinesh (28772).
